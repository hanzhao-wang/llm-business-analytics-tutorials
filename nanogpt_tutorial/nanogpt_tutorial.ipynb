    "#### Explanation: Tokenizer and Tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tokenizer** is a crucial component in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Its primary job is to break down a piece of text (like a sentence or a paragraph) into smaller units called **tokens**. These tokens can be words, sub-words, or even individual characters, depending on the type of tokenizer used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: computers don't understand words and sentences directly. They understand numbers. So, a tokenizer first segments the text and then, in conjunction with a vocabulary mapping (like our `stoi` and `itos` dictionaries), converts these tokens into numerical representations that a machine learning model can process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are using a **word-level tokenizer**. This means each token is a unique word or punctuation mark found in our text.\n",
    "- The `re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b|[^\\w\\s]', text.lower())` line is our simple tokenizer. It uses regular expressions to find sequences of word characters (`\\w+`) or any character that is not a word character or whitespace (`[^\\w\\s]`). This helps us capture both words and punctuation marks as separate tokens.\n",
    "- `stoi` (string to integer) maps each unique token (word/punctuation) to a unique integer.\n",
    "- `itos` (integer to string) does the reverse, mapping integers back to their original tokens.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the `get_batch` function, both the input `x` and the target `y` are sequences of `block_size` length. This might seem counterintuitive at first, as we are trying to predict the *next* word. Let's clarify:\n",
    "\n",
    "The task of a language model is to predict the next token in a sequence, given the preceding tokens.\n",
    "- `x` represents the **input context**: a sequence of words the model sees.\n",
    "- `y` represents the **target output**: for each position in `x`, `y` contains the word that *immediately follows* it in the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a `block_size` of 10.\n",
    "If `x` is `[word_1, word_2, ..., word_10]`,\n",
    "then `y` will be `[word_2, word_3, ..., word_11]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for each element `x[i]` in the input sequence (at a specific time step `t` within the block), the corresponding `y[i]` is the actual next word that the model should have predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when the model sees:\n",
    "- `x[0]` (i.e., `word_1`), it tries to predict `y[0]` (i.e., `word_2`).\n",
    "- `x[0:1]` (i.e., `word_1, word_2`), it tries to predict `y[1]` (i.e., `word_3`).\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- `x[0:9]` (i.e., `word_1, ..., word_10`), it tries to predict `y[9]` (i.e., `word_11`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model makes predictions for *every position* in the `block_size`. The loss function then compares all these predictions with the actual next words in `y`. This way, a single block of data provides `block_size` individual training examples for the model to learn from. The \"context\" for predicting `y[t]` is `x[0...t]`."

    "#### Explanation: The Overfitting Issue\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting** is a common problem in machine learning. It occurs when a model learns the training data *too well*, including its noise and specific details, to the point where it performs poorly on new, unseen data (like our validation set or real-world data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a student who memorizes the answers to all the questions in a specific textbook (the training data) but doesn't understand the underlying concepts. When given a new exam with slightly different questions (the validation or test data), the student would likely fail. This is analogous to an overfitted model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, since the training data (the first part of the text) is very different from the testing data (the second part), the LLM cannot learn to predict the testing data from training. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Signs of Overfitting:**\n",
    "-   **Training loss continues to decrease, while validation loss starts to increase or plateaus.** This is a classic indicator. It means the model is getting better at fitting the training data but worse (or no better) at generalizing to unseen data.\n",
    "-   The model might produce excellent results on examples it has seen during training but generate nonsensical or poor outputs for new inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Optianal) How `dropout` helps (as a regularization technique):**\n",
    "Dropout is a simple yet effective regularization technique to combat overfitting in neural networks. Here's how it works during training:\n",
    "1.  At each training step, for every neuron in a layer where dropout is applied, it is \"dropped out\" (i.e., temporarily removed from the network) with a certain probability (`dropout` rate).\n",
    "2.  This means the neuron, along with all its incoming and outgoing connections, is ignored during the forward pass and backward pass for that particular training iteration.\n",
    "3.  The choice of which neurons to drop is random for each training iteration and each input example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does this help?**\n",
    "-   **Prevents Co-adaptation:** Neurons become less reliant on specific other neurons because they can't be sure which ones will be active. This encourages each neuron to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with different random subsets of other neurons.\n",
    "-   **Ensemble Effect (Implicit):** Training with dropout can be seen as training a large number of thinned networks (networks with different subsets of neurons). At test time (when dropout is turned off), using the full network can be viewed as an approximation of averaging the predictions of these many thinned networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our configuration, we have `dropout = 0.0`. This means dropout is currently turned off. If you observe overfitting (e.g., validation loss increasing significantly while training loss is very low), you could try increasing the `dropout` rate (e.g., to 0.1 or 0.2) to see if it improves generalization. Note that dropout is typically applied during training only and is turned off during evaluation or inference (which `model.eval()` and `model.train()` handle for relevant layers in PyTorch)."

    "#### Explanation: Temperature and Sampling in Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "When our model generates text, it doesn't just pick the single most probable next word. Instead, it often uses a technique called **sampling**, sometimes influenced by a parameter called **temperature**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Logits and Probabilities:**\n",
    "    After processing the input context, the model outputs **logits**. These are raw, unnormalized scores for each word in the vocabulary. To turn these logits into probabilities (i.e., values between 0 and 1 that sum up to 1), we apply a **softmax function**. The word with the highest probability is the one the model thinks is most likely to come next.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Sampling:**\n",
    "    Instead of always picking the word with the absolute highest probability (which is called greedy decoding and can lead to repetitive or boring text), we can *sample* from the probability distribution. This means a word that is slightly less probable might still be chosen, introducing randomness and creativity into the generated text.\n",
    "    `torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)` is the function that performs this sampling. It takes the probability distribution (`probs`) and picks one word based on these probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Temperature:**\n",
    "    Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the sampling. It's applied to the logits *before* the softmax function.\n",
    "    -   **Low Temperature (e.g., < 1.0, closer to 0):** Dividing logits by a small number makes the differences between them larger. When softmax is applied, the probability distribution becomes \"sharper\" or \"spikier.\" The model becomes more confident and deterministic, tending to pick the most likely words. This can lead to more focused and coherent text, but potentially less creative.\n",
    "    -   **High Temperature (e.g., > 1.0):** Dividing logits by a larger number makes the differences between them smaller. The resulting softmax probability distribution becomes \"flatter\" or \"softer.\" The model becomes less confident, and less likely words have a higher chance of being selected. This increases randomness and creativity, but can also lead to more errors or nonsensical text.\n",
    "    -   **Temperature = 1.0:** This is the standard setting where the original probabilities are used for sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our generation code:\n",
    "`logits = logits / temperature`\n",
    "`probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "By adjusting the `temperature` value, you can control the trade-off between coherence and creativity in the generated text. For this tutorial, we use a temperature of 1.0, which means we sample directly from the model's learned probability distribution."
