    "#### Explanation: Maximum Possible Answer and Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are framing the addition problem \"a+b=\" as a **classification task**. This means the model's goal is not to generate the sequence of digits for the answer, but to predict which *single class* the answer belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like image classification where a model predicts if an image is a \"cat,\" \"dog,\" or \"bird.\" Here, our \"classes\" are all the possible numerical answers the addition problems can produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Defining the Classes:**\n",
    "    Since our input numbers `a` and `b` are limited by `ndigit` (e.g., for `ndigit=2`, numbers range from 0 to 99), there's a maximum possible sum.\n",
    "    - If `ndigit=2`, the largest sum is 99 + 99 = 198.\n",
    "    - The smallest sum is 0 + 0 = 0.\n",
    "    So, all possible answers lie in the range \\[0, 198].\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`num_answer_classes`:**\n",
    "    Each unique integer answer in this range becomes a distinct \"class\" for our model.\n",
    "    - `max_answer = (10**ndigit - 1) + (10**ndigit - 1)` calculates this maximum sum.\n",
    "    - `num_answer_classes = max_answer + 1` determines the total number of unique classes (from 0 up to `max_answer`, inclusive). For `ndigit=2`, this is 198 + 1 = 199 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Why Classification?**\n",
    "    By treating this as a classification problem:\n",
    "    - The model's output layer (the \"classification head\") will have `num_answer_classes` neurons.\n",
    "    - Each neuron corresponds to one possible sum (e.g., neuron 0 for answer \"0\", neuron 1 for answer \"1\", ..., neuron 198 for answer \"198\").\n",
    "    - The model will output a probability distribution over these classes, and the class with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted answer.\n",
    "    - We use `CrossEntropyLoss`, which is standard for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach simplifies the problem compared to generating an answer character by character, especially since the output (the sum) is a single entity. The model just needs to learn to map the input question sequence to the correct answer \"bucket\" or class."

    "#### Explanation: Padding Input Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer models, like the GPT-2 architecture we're using as a base, are designed to process sequences of a fixed length. However, our input questions (e.g., \"1+2=\", \"10+5=\", \"99+99=\") can have varying lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Padding?**\n",
    "1.  **Batch Processing:** To train neural networks efficiently, we feed data in batches. All sequences within a single batch must have the same length so they can be processed in parallel by the GPU or CPU.\n",
    "2.  **Fixed-Size Model Input:** The transformer architecture itself expects inputs of a predefined maximum sequence length (`n_positions` in `GPT2Config`, which we set to `max_question_length`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just like in Sklearn, when we want to use rows with missing value, we need to first fill these missing values to make every row has the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Padding Works:**\n",
    "1.  **Determine `max_question_length`:** We first calculate the maximum possible length an input question can have. For `ndigit=2`, the longest question is \"99+99=\" (6 characters). This becomes our `max_question_length`.\n",
    "2.  **Add a Padding Token:** We add a special padding character to our input vocabulary (in this case, a space ' ').\n",
    "3.  **Pad Shorter Sequences:** Any question shorter than `max_question_length` is padded with this special character (usually at the end) until it reaches the `max_question_length`.\n",
    "    - \"2+3=\" (length 4) with `max_question_length=6` becomes \"2+3=  \" (length 6).\n",
    "    - The `ljust(max_question_len)` method handles this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Optional) Attention Mechanism and Padding:**\n",
    "While the input sequences are padded, the transformer's attention mechanism can be designed (often through an attention mask) to ignore these padding tokens during computation. This ensures that the padding doesn't negatively influence the learning process. For this specific `GPT2Model` from Hugging Face, it typically handles attention masking internally based on standard padding token IDs or by allowing explicit attention masks. In our simplified setup, the model will still \"see\" the padding tokens, but their embeddings will be learned like any other token. The key is that the *structure* of the input is now uniform across the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This padding ensures that all input tensors passed to the model have a consistent shape, which is essential for the underlying computations and batching."

    "#### Explanation: Custom Classification Head\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard GPT-2 model from the `transformers` library, when used as `GPT2LMHeadModel`, is designed for **language modeling**. This means its primary goal is to predict the next token in a sequence, autoregressively. It has a \"language modeling head\" which is essentially a linear layer that maps the transformer's output hidden states to logits over the entire vocabulary (to predict the next word/character).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Task is Different:**\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are not performing traditional language modeling. Our task is **many-to-one classification**:\n",
    "-   **Input (Many):** A sequence of characters representing an addition problem (e.g., \"23+45=\").\n",
    "-   **Output (One):** A single class label representing the numerical answer (e.g., class 68).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why `GPT2Model` + Custom Head?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Leveraging Transformer Power:** We still want to use the powerful sequence processing capabilities of the transformer architecture (self-attention, positional encodings, etc.) to understand the input question \"23+45=\". `GPT2Model` provides the core transformer blocks (embedding layer, multiple transformer layers) without the final language modeling layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Tailoring to Classification:**\n",
    "    -   The output of `GPT2Model` is a sequence of hidden states, one for each input token. For our classification task, we are particularly interested in the information aggregated by the transformer over the entire sequence. A common strategy is to use the hidden state of the *last* token (or a special `[CLS]` token if one were used, or an aggregation like pooling). In our case, we use the hidden state corresponding to the final input token (which is often the '=' sign or a padding token if the actual question is shorter).\n",
    "    -   This chosen hidden state (a vector of size `n_embd`) is then fed into our custom **classification head**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **The `self.classifier`:**\n",
    "    Our classification head is a simple `nn.Linear` layer: `self.classifier = nn.Linear(n_embd, num_classes)`.\n",
    "    -   It takes the `n_embd`-dimensional feature vector from the transformer.\n",
    "    -   It projects this vector into a `num_classes`-dimensional space. Each dimension in this output corresponds to one of the possible numerical answers (from 0 to `max_answer`).\n",
    "    -   The output of this linear layer are the **logits** for our classification task. Applying a softmax function to these logits gives the probabilities for each possible answer class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we use `GPT2Model` as a powerful feature extractor for our input sequence and then add a simple linear layer (`self.classifier`) on top to perform the final classification into one of the `num_answer_classes`. This adapts the general-purpose transformer architecture to our specific arithmetic task."
